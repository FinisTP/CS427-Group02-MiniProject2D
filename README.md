### Introduction
Inspired by the famous childhood game Feeding Frenzy from Popcap Inc., we create "Grief of the Evergreen", a 2D game that can take the old experience to the next level. Using the idea from the Feeding Frenzy game, the world in Grief of the Evergreen is a world where the bigger ones eat the smaller ones to survive. However, this is not just a remake of an old game we all love, throughout Grief of the Evergreen, players will discover the story that we carefully created with meaningful messages about our environment.

The game is developed for 3 platforms containing Windows, IOS, and Android. For Android, you will need api level at least 21 to run the game. For IOS, we require version 7.0 or higher.

### Unity version
Unity 2020 LTS version 2020.3.10f1
